## Buzzword Dictionary

This is an ongoing project to document all of the terms and buzzwords that one encounters in learning to code.


We will improve this over time but right now, all the words and definitions can be found in [words.json](https://github.com/rcacademy/buzzwords/blob/gh-pages/words.json).

:warning: Keep in mind that we are only using the gh-pages branch of this repository as it will publish the buzzword dictionary to [http://rcacademy.github.io/buzzwords](http://rcacademy.github.io/buzzwords).

#### Adding a new term
* Fork this repository (someone should probably add that to the buzzword list).
* Add a new term to the `words.json` array.
* Submit a pull request (there's another buzzword) to have your word added to the dictionary!

#### Potential/Future Features
* The ability to view examples and use cases.
* The ability to view examples and use cases in multiple languages.
